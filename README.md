# Smooth_Blink_Project
This Project is what I made after learning about analog pin of Arduino Board.
In this project I use analogWrite() function instead of digitalWrite().
I write code in analogWrite as I can get OUTPUT other than MAX and MIN, like in digitalWrite.
I take output from PWM pin 9. These are unique pins that work on both digital and analog coe.
